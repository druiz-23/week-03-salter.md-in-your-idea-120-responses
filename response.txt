# Response to Entagngled & Rhizome Anthology
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>  From the reading of Entaganled, I gathered that "Gesamtkunstwerk" was term used to describe a complete body of art work. When I think of that I immediately think of installation art. I have visited a few exhibits of intstallation art exhibits, myself and have found that it usually involves most of our scenes to immerse ourselves in an experience.It typically uses various senses such as, visuals, sounds, temperature, touch and structure. I think there are many contemporary and physical tools that can be used to achieve a "Gesamtkunstwerk" experience. From the reading, I realized that structure is part of the experience which Wagner did by sinking the orchestra pit below the stage giving the auidence a direct view. Moreover, I believe that other physical elements such as, shapes, textures and touch can make art a grander experience. In terms of contemporary elements, there are several elements that can add to the complete body of work. It could be anything from screen projections to color changing lighting and of course computer programming. 
 <p>This is a paragraph.</p>   Throughout my browsing on Rhizome Anthology, I don't think I would qualify them as fully "Gesamtkunstwerk". I did see some pieces like "A Cyberfeminist Manifesto for The 21ST Century" that used multiple multimedia forms to express political position. They used art and text to distribute the message using fax, snail mail, billboard and online posts. In turn using the propoganda technique to create a wider net auidence. And through this body of work it created other spin offs that artist adapted to. Moreover, I do admire that they used every avenue available to plaster their message across society. And although I would not classify it as a complete body of work but I would say it is a close stepping stone at achieving a full experience.
